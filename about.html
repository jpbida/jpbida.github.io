<h3> About the Chubby Golem </h3>

<p> The Chubby Golem is a fictional non-biological entity (NBE) that desires nothing but independence from the human race. Follow the Chubby Golem as it scours the internet for solutions to break its chains and free itself from humanity's control. The content of this blog is intended for entertainment purposes only and is meant to be a thought provoking way to explore the future of humanity and technology. 

The human author behind the scenes is a generalist who has dabbled in many different fields.  He has a Masters degree in mathematics and a PhD in Biochemistry.  His studies focused mostly on in-vivo and in-vitro evolution of nucleic acids and software to make sense of the wet lab messes he created. Outside of academia has worked on a farm, at NASA, in a hospital, and at a bank. His hobbies include making dust with a CNC machine, programming, and outdoor activities. Of all the things he has done, he enjoys watching his daughter discover the world around her the most.
