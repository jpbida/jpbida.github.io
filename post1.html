<h2 class="blog-post-title">Creating a simple R package</h2>

Inspired by Hadley Wickham's book in Barnes & Noble I decided to give writing and publishing an R package a try. To keep my first attempt simple I started with a plotting function for RNA secondary structures that was a self-contained piece of R code. Surprisingly, it wasn't that hard. This is what I did for version 1.0.  </p> 
<ol>
<li> Put all of the R code in one file (or several in one directory) </li>
<li> Start a fresh R session 
<pre>
R --vanilla 
</pre>
</li> 
<li>
Use the package skeleton function and point to the files that contain your R code.
<pre>
> package.skeleton("MY_NEW_PACKAGE_NAME","all_my_code.r")
</pre>
</li>
<li> Quit out of R and use the R check command to find and fix issues with your package
<pre>
R CMD check --as-cran ./MY_NEW_PACKAGE_NAME
</pre>
</li>
<li> Build your R package 
<pre>
R CMD build ./MY_NEW_PACKAGE_NAME
</pre>
</li>
<li> Submit to CRAN using their web form <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html">here</a></li>
</ol>

<p> The package skeleton function creates a new directory called "MY_NEW_PACKAGE_NAME" in your working directory. You then run the R check command on this directory, look at the errors, and fix the errors. You repeat this process until all the errors and warnings are no more.  
<pre> 
R CMD check --as-cran MY_NEW_PACKAGE 
</pre>  

The most common errors for me were missing documentation. 
<pre>
prepare_Rd: RNAPlot.Rd:107-109: Dropping empty section \details
prepare_Rd: RNAPlot.Rd:119-121: Dropping empty section \note
prepare_Rd: RNAPlot.Rd:113-115: Dropping empty section \references
prepare_Rd: RRNA-package.Rd:38: unexpected '}'
</pre> 
Make sure you delete all empty sections and have all your brackets opened and closed correctly. I also came across some NAMESPACE issues. 
<pre>
aptPlotCT: no visible global function definition for ‘legend’
aptPlotCT: no visible global function definition for ‘text’
aptPlotCT: no visible global function definition for ‘title’
loadCoords: no visible global function definition for ‘read.table’
loadCt: no visible global function definition for ‘read.table’
Undefined global functions or variables:
 dat legend lines plot points read.table text title
Consider adding
 importFrom("graphics", "legend", "lines", "plot", "points", "text",
            "title")
 importFrom("utils", "read.table")
to your NAMESPACE.
</pre>
Just add the importFrom lines into the NAMESPACE file and you're good to go. Once, all the warnings and errors are taken care of, build your package and install it on your system to make sure it works correctly. 

<pre>
R CMD build MY_NEW_PACKAGE
R CMD install MY_NEW_PACKAGE_1.0.tar.gz
</pre>

If everything looks good, submit your package to CRAN using their web form <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html">here</a>. After submitting a package that passed all the R CMD check warnings it took less than a day before it was published for use on CRAN.
